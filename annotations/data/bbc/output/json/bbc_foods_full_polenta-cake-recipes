Drain and leave to cool. Butter a springform cake tin, 23cm/9in wide and 7cm/23\u20444in deep. Add 1-2 tablespoons of polenta, tip the grains around until the tin is coated, then knock out the excess. Set aside. Whizz the flaked almonds to a grainy powder in a food processor, then mix in a bowl with the polenta and baking powder. Set aside. Halve the cooked oranges and remove any pips. Remove zest from the third orange. Whizz the zest and the orange halves (with skin on) to a smooth pur\u00e9e in the food processor. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 180C/Gas 4/fan oven 160C. Using a mixer or electric beaters, beat the eggs, yolks and sugar for a good 5-7 minutes until the batter looks like a very thick milkshake. Quickly beat in the almond mixture, then the pur\u00e9e until just blended. Pour the batter into the tin, leaving at least 1.5cm/5\u20448in at the top. Bake the cake in the middle of the oven. After 10 minutes, reduce the temperature to 150C/ Gas 2/fan oven 130C, bake for 30 minutes, then reduce temperature to 140C/fan oven 120C for a further 30 minutes (if you have a gas oven, cook at gas 4 for 10 minutes, then at gas 2 for 11\u20444 hours until done without reducing the temperature further). The cake is ready when it has risen, is golden-brown and the centre is just firm \u2013 don\u2019t panic that it still feels fragile. Leave the cake to cool in its tin (it will sink a little), then run a palette knife around the edge before releasing the sides. Only attempt to transfer it from the metal base to a decorative plate or stand if you have a proper cake lifter. Whisk the liqueur and marmalade into the mascarpone. Serve the cake in thick wedges with the mascarpone dolloped on top. RECIPE TIPSGETTING AHEADThe cake can be baked up to 3 days ahead as long\r\nas it\u2019s kept in a sealed tin.

Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 1 hr or until tender. Drain and cool. Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. Butter a 20cm springform cake tin and line the base with a disc of buttered baking parchment. Cut the cooked clementines in half and remove any pips. Place in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until finely chopped but not pur\u00e9ed. Combine the raisins, sultanas, currants, cherries and brandy in a bowl. Add the clementine pulp and mix well. Cream the butter and sugar together until pale. Add the beaten eggs, a little at a time, mixing well between each addition. In another bowl, combine the spices, ground almonds, polenta and baking powder. Fold into the creamed mixture along with the dried fruit and clementine pulp. Spoon into the prepared tin and smooth the top. Bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 30 mins. Reduce the oven temperature to 160C/fan 140C/gas 3 and continue to cook for a further 40 mins. You may need to loosely cover the top of the cake with a sheet of baking parchment for the final 20 mins to prevent it browning too quickly. Cool in the tin for 30 mins before turning out onto a cooling rack. To make the topping, slice the clementines to a 5mm thickness. Tip the sugar into a saucepan with 140ml water and cook over a low heat, stirring often, until the sugar has dissolved. Put the clementine slices in the pan and stir through. To keep the clementines submerged in the syrup, cut out a circle of greaseproof paper to fit into the pan and place over the fruit. Cook over a low heat for 1 hr until glossy and translucent. Remove and spread out over greaseproof paper to cool. To serve, dust the whole cake with icing sugar, then arrange the clementine slices, overlapping, over the top of the cake.", "serves": "8 - 10", "time": {"Prep:": "30 mins", "Cook:": "2 hrs and 10 mins"}, "nutrients": {"kcal": "695", "fat": "34g", "saturates": "15g", "carbs": "93g", "sugars": "83g", "fibre": "3g", "protein": "9g", "salt": "0.36g"}, "uuid": "84436bd2-d7f4-4392-acac-071e894f5fb7"}}}
